		  Principle 1: Importance of decision-making criteria
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">
		</br></br>
		
		Yearly, hundreds, if not thousands of animals enter shelters, and multiple decisions must be made; for example, knowledge of where one should house an animal; finding out whether rescue contact should be initiated; whether an additional investment in the animal, like medical treatment, is needed and affordable; whether the animal is safe for adoption or poses a risk to the public; etc. </br></br>
		  This quickly amounts to dozens of decisions required each Moreover, if one does accept the animal into the shelter, you must seamlessly execute the appropriate steps to accomplish these essential tasks. We owe it to the animals and ourselves to ensure that these critical choices are made based on well-thought-out criteria designed to maximize welfare and the numbers of animals released into the public. All while minimizing the holding time and suffering from animals that will ultimately be euthanized. </br></br>

		  Principle 2: Avoiding decision fatigue
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">
		
		</br></br></h>"Decision fatigue" is a well-documented phenomenon in which the quality of decisions deteriorates after extended decision-making sessions. This is no reflection on the decision maker's intention, intelligence, or effort but a simple result of depletion of the brain's resources. After a barrage of choices, people are unable to evaluate the options at hand rationally.</br></br>The greater the consequences of being weighed with each choice, the more rapidly decision fatigue sets in (for example, several studies have found poor people are more depleted by shopping than wealthy ones, perhaps because each choice requires a more significant trade-off).

		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">

	
								</br></br></br>
		  For an open-intake shelter, if healthy animals are routinely admitted over the number released alive, the "choice" is made daily that some animals will be euthanized. </br></br>It only remains to be seen which ones. If the policy is not euthanized for space or time, the default system will await illness or behavioral disorders development. Each shelter and community has a finite ability to rehome animals within any given period</br></br>Top 5 Principles of Adoption Best Practices

		  Principle 4: Defining "unadoptable"
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">
	 </br></br></br></br>
							
	Identifying not adoptable animals at a given facility helps make a "first cut" and entails a more easily defined set of standards than deciding amongst animals of varying levels of "adaptability." First, develop a list of medical, behavioral, and other conditions that will automatically disqualify an animal for adoption or admission. Note which of these, if any, will also disqualify an animal for rescue or other avenues for live release (e.g., spay/neuter/vaccinate/return). </br></br>    Examples may (or may not, depending on shelter and community resources) include the history of biting or seriously injuring humans; history of killing livestock or other pets; un-handle-able for examination or vaccination (define time frame after shelter intake to allow adaptation to the new environment.) </br></br>

		  Principle 5: Defining adoptability criteria for "adoptable" animals
		</div>

													 <div class="stepContent">  </br></br></br>Ideally, the goal would be to admit or place up for adoption only those reasonably likely to be adopted based on individual characteristics and overall numbers. Over time, adoptions will likely increase, and criteria can be expanded to include an ever-widening pool of animals. Ultimately, the only animals admitted to the shelter for euthanasia would be those that are a danger to others or are irremediably suffering.</br> </br>

		  Principle 6: Establishing the baseline
  </div>

		<div class="stepContent">
			</br></br> 
 As a baseline, determine how many animals entered the shelter free of any criteria for non-adoptability, as described above (e.g., dangerously aggressive, terminally ill). These are the "Theoretically Adoptable (TA)" animals, among which choices may need to be made for actual admission or adoption.
Determine the proportion of those animals adopted by looking at adoption as a percentage of animals admitted. </br></br>Adoption criteria will aim to develop alternatives to intake for the approximate rate of animals not adopted. Remember, a decision-making system will not increase euthanasia but only codify the criteria to allow a more consistent, thoughtful, and humane process. Not admitting a cat is always an option if euthanasia is not preferable to the cat's existing circumstances..</br></br>

		  Principle 7: Create a scoring system
		</div>

		<div class="stepContent">
			</br></br>
Assign a score to categories within at least each of the following groups: behavior, age, color/breed, health, and "special characteristics." 
Do not include a score for conditions considered "unadoptable," as a different process will evaluate these. </br></br>
Think of the middle score as "zero" and imagine a cat that is "neutral" for adoption – nothing firmly in its favor, but no characteristics making adoption less likely.</br></br>Then consider features that make a cat more or less adoptable, and weigh them above and below "zero" based on the collective impression of importance in that shelter. </br></br>The unique characteristics category is for conditions that increase the likelihood of adoption over and above the basic behavior, age, and health scores.
